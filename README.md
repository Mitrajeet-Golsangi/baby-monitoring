# Monitoring-Baby-System-based-on-Deep-Learning

The monitoring of young children is one of the issues of interest of parents in a busy life, in this topic, our group will give ideas and implement solutions for monitoring young children while ensuring the movement of young children during sleep and wake up through the camera. 

In this project, the LSTM network will be built and combined with the Media Pipe library to automatically identify the child's facial features andCancel changes skeleton to detect behaviors such as:

#1. Detection baby wake up


#3. Detection baby moving


#5. Detection baby outside
